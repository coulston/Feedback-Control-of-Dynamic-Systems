\item \hwpath{L2ElectricalSystems}{05} 
\item \hwpath{L2ElectricalSystems}{06} 

\item Quiz Question Friday: \hwpath{L0XComplexNumberReview}{02}
\item Quiz Question Monday: \hwpath{L1ModelingMechanicalSystems}{04} 

\item To help us get to know you, please edit your Canvas profile to add a profile picture in which we can see your face. For help, see https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10599-4212710334.

\item As part of the course, we will be using MATLAB as a tool for doing numerical calculations and displaying results. If you are not familiar with MATLAB, please go through the Matlab on-ramp tutorial https://www.mathworks.com/training-schedule/matlab-onramp.html. At the completion of the tutorial, you can generate a certificate indicating your completion. As part of your homework, either submit the certificate, or submit a statement ``I am already very familiar with Matlab and take responsibility for knowing what was covered in the Matlab on-ramp tutorial.''
