Consider again the previous HW problem in which you designed a PI controller for a tank system and which is re-printed below.  Below that is a previous semester's problem with almost the same desired learning outcomes but different wording.  Consider the Social Justice Criteria
%:
%\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
%\item Contextual Listening
%\item Identifying Structural Conditions
%\item Acknowledging Political Agency/Mobilizing Power 
%\item Increasing Opportunities and Resources
%\item Reducing Imposed Risks and Harms
%\item Enhancing Human Capabilities
%\end{enumerate}
``Increasing Opportunities and Resources'' and ``Reducing Imposed Risks and Harms.'' 
In a few sentences each, reflect on how the revised problem challenges you to think about %at least two of 
these criteria more than the previous semester's problem.
