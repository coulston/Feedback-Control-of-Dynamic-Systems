The speed of a small wind turbine used to provide power to a remote village can be represented by the differential equation
\[
J \dot{\omega} = \tau_{aero} - \tau_c
\]
where $J$ is the rotational inertia of the turbine, $\omega$ is its rotational speed, $\tau_{aero}$ is the aerodynamic torque caused by the wind, and $\tau_c = 2K \omega$ is the control torque.  \\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the transfer function from the input aerodynamic torque to the output rotor speed?\\
  \item Considering the form of the differential equation or the transfer function, does the control torque behave most like a spring or a damper?  Why?\\
\end{enumerate}
