Using the provided log scale, sketch the Bode plot for $G(s) = \frac{5}{s^2+4s+25}$
using linear approximation rules. For full credit, label and scale each y-axis. Indicate the slope of each segment, and the magnitude and phase at each break point. Find the magnitude at the resonant frequency $\omega_{n}$ and modify the linear approximation to account for any resonance.
