The system shown in the Bode plot below is proposed for use as a low-pass filter to reduce high-frequency noise picked up by a sensor.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item From this Bode plot, what is the steady-state output signal $y_{ss}(t)$ for each of the following input signals: $u(t) = 5\cos(0.1t)$ and $u(t) = 5\cos(10t)$?
\item Based on your answer to (a), does $G(s)$ successfully reduce high-frequency noise compared to low frequency noise? For full credit, briefly explain why or why not.
\end{enumerate}
