A wind turbine blade's fatigue strength can be tested by applying a sinusoidal force input across a million or more cycles and measuring the damage to the blade components. Assume the transfer function $G(s)$ from force $F(s)$ to blade tip displacement $X(s)$ is

\item The engineers want to achieve the maximum damage (displacement amplitude) for minimum energy (force amplitude). What frequency $\omega$ of input sinusoid $f(t) = \cos (\omega t)$ should they choose to achieve this objective? For full credit, briefly explain your reasoning.
\item Given your answer to (a) and also your understanding of the phase Bode plot, which of the following output signals (1, 2, or 3) most closely matches what you expect to see for the steady state blade tip position $x(t)$? For full credit, briefly explain your reasoning. \\
