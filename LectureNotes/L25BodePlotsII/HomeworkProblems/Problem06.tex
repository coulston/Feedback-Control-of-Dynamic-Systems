A second order system has transfer function
\[
G(s) = \frac{200}{s^{2}+10s+100}
\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Using the linear approximation rules, sketch the Bode plot using the provided log scale

\item  According to your sketch, if the input to the system is $\cos(20t)$ what is the steady state output?
\item  According to your sketch, if the input to the system is $\cos(10t)$ what is the steady state output?
\item  Using the transfer function, if the input to the system is $\cos(10t)$ what is the steady state output?
