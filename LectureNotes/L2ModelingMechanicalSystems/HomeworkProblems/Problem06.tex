 A pickup truck is towing the space shuttle into a museum. Consider the horizontal motion of this system. Assume mass of shuttle is M and that of pickup truck is m. The shuttle linkage to the truck can be assumed to have some flexibility.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Select an appropriate input and an appropriate output, given that the ultimate goal is to put the shuttle in a desired location in the museum.  \textit{Note that there are multiple correct answers to this problem.}
\item Draw a model of the truck/shuttle system using idealized elements.  Your selected input and output signals should be clearly designated on your drawing.  Again, there are multiple correct answers; please justify your choices.
\item Find the differential equations describing the truck/shuttle system.  You should expect to have as many equations as you do masses.
\end{enumerate}
