A glider is towed behind an airplane. Consider the horizontal motion of this system consisting of the tow plane, rope, and glider. \begin{enumerate}
\item What are the input and output signals to this system? In other words, what can you control and what will you measure?
\item Draw a model using idealized elements. Be sure to indicate the input signal, output signal, any other signals necessary to write the differential equations, and also the parameters associated with each system element (e.g., mass, spring, and damper values). 
\item Find the differential equations describing this system.
\end{enumerate}
