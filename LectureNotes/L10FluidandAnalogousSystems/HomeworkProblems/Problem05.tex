A cup with vertical walls (like a coffee cup) is filled with water (density $\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^{3}$) to a height of 5cm. The cross sectional area of the cup is $.002$ m$^2$. A hole is punched in the bottom, and it takes 20 seconds for the water to fall to 2.5cm. Assuming linear behavior, what is the valve constant, $R$, for the hole? Assume the gravitation constant $g=9.81$ m/s$^{2}$.
