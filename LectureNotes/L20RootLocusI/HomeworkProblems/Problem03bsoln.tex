(d) The Matlab verification of the root locus can be performed using the commands \\
>> gs=zpk([],[-1 -1 -2],1) \\
>> rlocus(gs,logspace(-2,2,250)) \% Note: the ``logspace'' command generates a user-defined vector spaced logarithmically, in this case from 10$^-2$ to 10$^2$ with 250 elements.  You might find this helpful when using the cursor tool to check values in the root locus plots (to obtain a finer resolution in the gain values).  \\ 
The plot is shown below. \\
