Consider the following feedback control system
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,inner sep=0pt,outer sep=0pt,very thick,
sysblock/.style={draw,rectangle,inner sep=2pt,minimum width=1.25cm,minimum height=1.25cm,very thick}]
\draw (2,0) node[draw,circle] (sum1) {$\rule{0pt}{18pt}$};
\draw (3.5,0) node[sysblock] (Kp) {$ K$};
\draw (6,0) node[sysblock] (G) {\Large $\frac{1}{(s^2+2s+2)(s+5)}$};
\draw[->] (.5,0) node[above=2pt] {$R(s)$} -- (sum1.180) node[above left=2pt] {$+$};
\draw[->] (sum1.0) --  (Kp);
\draw[->] (Kp) -- (G);
\draw[->] (G.0) -- ++(1.5,0) node[above=2pt] {$Y(s)$};
\draw[->] (G.0) ++(0.5,0) -- ++(0,-1.5) -| (sum1.-90) node[below right=2pt] {$-$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Using the rules covered in lecture, make a sketch of the root locus of closed loop poles for the following feedback system. Confirm your sketch using the \texttt{rlocus} command in \textsc{Matlab}.\vspace{.1in}
\item As the control system engineer, you noticed if the gain is too large the system would go unstable, and thought it would be prudent to add a zero to the control law so that the controller would change from $K$ to $K(s+a)$.  Find the value of $a$ such that the root locus for large gain follows a vertical asymptote with real part equal to -2.
