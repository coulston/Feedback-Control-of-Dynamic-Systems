Two root locus rules give us all of the information we need to solve this problem.

First, we know that loci on the real axis are always to the left of an odd number of real poles and zeros.  Therefore, plot (a) must be wrong.

Second, we know that loci travel from poles to zeros.  In this case, the plant $G(s)$ has three finite poles and one finite zero, so we know that two loci must go to infinity.  Therefore the correct answer is (b).

The Matlab-generated root locus is shown here for comparison.
