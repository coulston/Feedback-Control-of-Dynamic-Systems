Consider a feedback control system with the following loop gain:
\[
L(s) = H(s)G(s)C(s) =  \frac{90}{s^{2}+9s+18}.
\]
Using \textsc{Matlab}, obtain a Nyquist plot.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Using the Nyquist stability criterion, determine if a feedback system with this loop gain is closed loop stable. 
\item Now add a delay of 0.5 sec to $G(s)$, plot the Nyquist plot, and reevaluate this stability. (Hint: add an exponential term as in section 4 of the ``Systems with Time Delay" lecture article). 
\end{enumerate}
