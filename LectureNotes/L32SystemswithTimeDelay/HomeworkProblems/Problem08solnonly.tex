\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $GM \approx 50 dB, \phi_{PM} \approx 30 deg$
\item (For phase margin from (a)) $T_d \approx \frac{\pi}{3.6}$. Note: the Bode plot in the solutions is of poor quality, making it difficult to read the crossover frequency accurately. The allowable time delay will vary accordingly. 
\end{enumerate}
