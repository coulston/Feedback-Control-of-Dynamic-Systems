For an underdamped second order system, let the peak time $t_{p}$ be the time at which the maximum peak overshoot occurs. Find the equation for the peak time $t_{p}$. (Hint: this is derived in Lecture \SecondOrderResponseNumber). Sketch the region in the complex plane where the poles can lie if the peak time satisfies $t_{p}< 1$ sec.
