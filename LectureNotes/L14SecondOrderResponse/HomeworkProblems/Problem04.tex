A system is described by the transfer function
\[
\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{s+4}{s^2+4s+9}
\]
If $R(s)$ is a unit step, what is the time for the system output to settle within 1\% of the final value,
the rise time and percent overshoot for the system response? Use \textsc{Matlab} to help answer this question. Compare your answer to the result
you get using the formulas for $\tr$ and  $\OS$ that are valid for a system without zeros.
