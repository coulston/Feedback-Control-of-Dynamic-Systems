Suppose you are tasked with designing a controller but the specification that is supplied is not one that we have covered yet. Find a function that relates poles to the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item For a first order system, the time to go from 0 to 90\% of the final value
\item For a second order system, the time for the slope, $\frac{dy}{dt}$, to reach its peak value
\end{itemize}
