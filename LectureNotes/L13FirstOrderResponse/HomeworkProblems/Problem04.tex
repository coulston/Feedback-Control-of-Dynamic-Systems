A client provides you with a transfer function and unit step response plot for a system you are analyzing. 
\[
G(s)=\frac{100}{s+50}
\]

% Note to self: plot made with $G(s) = \frac{10}{s+5}$

	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item Based on the client-provided transfer function $G(s)$, estimate the rise time and 1\% settling time for the step response. \textit{Only one significant digit is needed; feel free to use rounding approximations such as $1.4 \approx 1$ and $1.6 \approx 2$.} 
	%\item Mark on the plot where the rise time and 1\% settling time would be measured (based on the plot, not part (a)), labeling $t_r$ and $t_s$.
	\item Estimate  the rise time and 1\% settling time  from the plot. 
	\item Did the client provide the plot that corresponds to the transfer function? For full credit, briefly explain why or why not within the space provided.
\end{enumerate}
