A system is described by the transfer function
\[
\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{6}{s+2}
\]
If $R(s)$ is a unit step, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate the 1\% settling time and 10\%-90\% rise time according to techniques used in class.
\item Use Matlab to plot the step response. For full credit, include the Matlab plot in your HW submission (see part (c)).
\item Use your Matlab plot to verify your estimates in part (a).  For full credit, label the rise time and settling time on the plot and submit it with your homework.
\end{enumerate}
