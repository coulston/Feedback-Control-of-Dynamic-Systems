	\maketitle


This is a handout illustrating the sketching process for the Bode plot of 
\[
G(s) =\frac{s-1}{s + 10}
\]
Answers are available in the Lecture~\BodePlotsIIINumber~article.

Before beginning to work through the questions, put $G(s)$ in ``Bode form'' by factoring out the coefficients on $s^0=1$ from the numerator and denominator of $G(s)$.

Next, work through these questions. A set of blank Bode axes is available on the reverse.

	\item What is the magnitude in dB of the DC gain of $G(s)$? In other words, what is $20 \log_{10}(K)$? Mark this value on the magnitude Bode plot at the left edge. \textit{Hint: use the ``Bode form'' of $G(s)$.} \\\vspace{0.9in}
	\item What is the low frequency phase of $G(s)$, i.e., $\angle K$? Mark this point on the phase Bode plot at the left edge. \\\vspace{0.8in}
	\item Will the magnitude at high frequencies be smaller or larger than the magnitude at low frequencies (near DC)? \textit{Hint: think about moving from left to right along the $x$ axis of the Bode plot, i.e., from lower or higher frequencies. Do you encounter the frequency of the zero $\sigma_z$ or the pole $\sigma_p$ first? If you encounter the zero first, the magnitude plot has a positive slope, whereas if you encounter the pole first, the magnitude plot has a negative slope.} \\\vspace{1in}\textcolor{white}{filler text to make the credits in the right spot}%\\\vspace{1.5in}
	\item What will be the total phase change of the phase Bode plot given the RHP zero and LHP pole? Add this total phase change to your low-frequency phase found in \#2 and mark the result on the right side of the phase Bode plot, i.e., at high frequency. \textit{Hint: refer to the table in Lecture~\BodePlotsIIINumber~and remember that phase impacts take place over two decades.} \\\vspace{1.2in}
	\item What are the asymptotic phase slopes at medium frequencies (near the zero $\sigma_z$ and the pole $\sigma_p$)? \textit{Hint: refer again to the table in Lecture~\BodePlotsIIINumber.} \\\vspace{1.2in}
