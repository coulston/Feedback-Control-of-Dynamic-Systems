 Read about tuned mass dampers \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_damper}. The following system figure is given in the article:

The following description is given for the figure: \begin{quote}Given a motor with mass  $m_{1}$ attached via motor mounts to the ground, the motor vibrates as it operates and the soft motor mounts act as a parallel spring and damper, $k_{1}$ and $c_{1}$. The force on the motor mounts is $F_{0}$. In order to reduce the maximum force on the motor mounts as the motor operates over a range of speeds, a smaller mass, $m_{2}$, is connected to $m_{1}$ by a spring and a damper, $k_{2}$ and $c_{2}$. $F_{1}$ is the effective force on the motor due to its operation.\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item First, we will analyze the system with the absorber removed (i.e. take $m_{2}=c_{2}=k_{2}=0$). Take $m_{1}=5$, $c_{1}=5$, and $k_{1}=420$. We want to find the transfer function $F_{0}(s)/F_{1}(s)$ (i.e. how much force on the motor mount occurs due to motor vibration). Show that the impedance network corresponding to this system is the following.\vspace{.1in}

\draw (R1) -| (C1);
\draw (R1) -| (I1);
\draw (I1) -- (f);
\draw (f) -- (d);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}\vspace{.1in}
Using this impedance network, find $F_{0}(s)/F_{1}(s)$ (Hint: Current divider). Using \textsc{Matlab}, plot the Bode plot
\item Now, attach the absorber with $m_{2}=0.5$, $c_{2}=.5$ and $k_{2}=42$. Find the new impedance network and new transfer function $F_{0}(s)/F_{1}(s)$ in this case (Hint: Current divider!!!). Plot the Bode plot. 
\end{enumerate}
When comparing your plots to the ones in the Wikipedia page, note that they used a log-scale magnitude plot, rather than plotting in decibels.
