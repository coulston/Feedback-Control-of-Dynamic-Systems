Using the provided log axes, sketch the Bode plot (using linear approximation rules) for the following systems
\begin{enumerate}
\item \[ G(s) = \frac{1+0.1s}{s(s+1)(1+0.01s)}\]
\item \[ G(s) = \frac{0.5(s+1)}{s(1+0.2s)(1+s+0.5s^2)}\]
\item \[ G(s) = \frac{s+1}{s(1+0.2s)(1+0.5s)}\]
\item \[ G(s) = \frac{1}{s(s+1)(1+0.5s)}\]
\end{enumerate}
For full credit, label and scale each axis. Indicate the slope of each segment, and the magnitude and phase at each break point.  Compare your answers to the Bode plots generated using Matlab using the ``bode'' command.
