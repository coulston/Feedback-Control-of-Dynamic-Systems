Match each Bode plot below (labeled (a)-(d)) to the correct system $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$, or $G_4$. Although it is possible to complete the problem quickly using Matlab, for full credit you must show at least one relevant argument based on your knowledge of Bode plots to perform the match. For example, you could discuss the low-frequency magnitude, the total phase change, the magnitude slope at low or high frequency, and/or other relevant facts.
