A low-pass filter
$$G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{1000}{s^2+s+100}$$
is used to reduce high-frequency noise in the measured signal r(t).   Find the steady-state output $y_{ss}(t)$ when $r(t) = 100cos(55t)$ using the values from the Bode plot of $G(s)$ and the tables provided.  Simlpify your answer by performing all artithmetic operations possible.
