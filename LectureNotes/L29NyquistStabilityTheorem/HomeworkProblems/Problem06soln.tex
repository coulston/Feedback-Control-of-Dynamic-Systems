\begin{enumerate}
\item The magnitude Bode plot doesn't really help us to narrow down the options since the magnitude in each case is roughly in the range of 1.5 to 2.  Therefore, focus on the phase Bode plot, which starts at 360 deg, drops through 270 deg, and finally ends at 180 deg.  We can therefore rule out (A) since its phase stays close to 360 (or 0).  (B) appears close at first glance, but the Nyquist plot is moving in the wrong direction (starting at 360=0, going to 90, then 180).  Therefore, the answer must be (C).
\item Note that there is one clockwise encirclement of the point (-1,0) in the Nyquist plot.  Therefore, $N=1$.  There are no unstable open-loop poles, so $P=0$.  Therefore, $Z=N+P=1$, which means that there is one unstable closed-loop pole and the closed-loop system is therefore unstable.
\end{enumerate}
