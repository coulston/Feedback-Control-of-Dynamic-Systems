A control systems engineer has calculated that an experimental system can be represented by the transfer function 
\[
\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{s+80}{(s+10)(s^2+s+4)}
\]

\begin{enumerate}[(a))]
\item Predict the rise time, percent overshoot, and final value of the signal $y(t)$ in response to a unit step input $r(t)$. 
\item In an experiment, the engineer observes the following unit step response, that is, the measurement $y_m(t)$, where measurement noise can be seen. By comparing the measured data to the predicted $t_r$, \%OS, and final value of $y(t)$ from part (a), determine the most significant error in the transfer function. For full credit, briefly explain your reasoning within the space provided.
\end{enumerate}
