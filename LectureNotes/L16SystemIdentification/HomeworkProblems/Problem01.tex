Unit step response experiments were performed on two systems, and are shown below. Estimate the transfer functions that represent each of these systems

\item\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=3in]{\mainfolder/LectureNotes/\lecturefolder/HomeworkProblems/figures/prob1b}\end{center}
\end{enumerate}
Using \textsc{Matlab}, plot the step response of your estimated transfer functions. (See Lecture 12, section 4).
