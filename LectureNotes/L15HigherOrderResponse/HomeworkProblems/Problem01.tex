For the following systems, sketch the poles and zero(s) in the complex plane, circle the dominant pole(s), and find an approximation (if any) that contains the dominant pole or poles and any other terms that cannot be approximated away. In other words, your answer may have a single or pair of dominant poles, additional pole(s) too close to eliminate, and/or zero(s) too close to eliminate. Be sure to match your DC gains from your original system $G(s)$ to approximated system $\hat{G}(s)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G(s) = \frac{s+10}{(s+.5)(s^2 +3s+ 25)}$
\item $G(s) = \frac{s+100}{(s+50)(s^2 +3s+ 25)}$
\end{enumerate}
