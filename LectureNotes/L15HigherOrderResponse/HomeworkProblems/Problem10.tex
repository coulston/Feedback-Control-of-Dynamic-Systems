You wish to design a system that will have a step response that has $\OS\leq10\%$, $\ts\leq2.3$s, and $\tr\leq1.1$s. On a complex axis such as shown below, sketch the acceptable location for the poles of a second order system that meets these specs. Scale all axes.

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.0]
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (10,0) node[above]{Re$\{s\}$};
\draw[->] (8,-4) -- (8,4) node[right]{Im$\{s\}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
