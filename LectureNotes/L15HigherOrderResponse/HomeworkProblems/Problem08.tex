A certain servomechanism system has dynamics dominated by a pair of complex poles and no finite zeros. The time-domain specifications on the rise time ($\tr$), percent overshoot ($\OS$) and settling time ($\ts$) are given by
\begin{align*}
\tr &\leq 0.6 \mbox{ sec},\\
\OS & \leq 10\%,\\
\ts & \leq 9.2 \mbox{ sec}.
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Sketch the region in the $s$-plane where the poles could be placed so that the system will meet all three specifications
\item Indicate on your sketch the specific locations (denoted by $\times$) that will meet the overshoot spec, and have the smallest rise-time while also meeting the settling time specification {\em exactly}.
\end{enumerate}
