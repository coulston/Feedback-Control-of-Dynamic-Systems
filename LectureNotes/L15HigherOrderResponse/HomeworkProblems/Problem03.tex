Suppose the specifications for the desired closed loop behavior of a feedback system are
\begin{itemize}
\item Step response rise time $t_{r}<.5$ s
\item Step response settling time $t_{s}<2$ s
\item Step response max overshoot \%OS$<20$\%
\end{itemize}
Determine the acceptable range of values for $\zeta$ and $\omega_{n}$ of the closed loop poles that meet the step response transient specifications, and sketch the region in the complex plane where these poles can lie.
