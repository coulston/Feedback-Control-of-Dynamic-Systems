The plot below shows the bounds of the allowable pole locations to meet step response specifications of $\OS<20\%$ and settling time $\ts\leq 8$s.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Indicate on the plot which line(s) correspond to the percent overshoot requirement and which line(s) correspond to the settling time requirement.
\item Shade in the allowable pole location on the plot
\item Suppose a system has transfer function $T(s) = \frac{1}{s^{2}+3s+4}$. Mark the  location of the poles on the plot using an $\times$, and determine if the step response specifications are met. 
\end{enumerate}
