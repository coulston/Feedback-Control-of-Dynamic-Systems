Imagine a mass-spring-damper system with transfer function from force $f(t)$ to position $y(t)$ given by
\[
\frac{Y(s)}{F(s)} = \frac{1}{s^2 + 2as + (a^2+1)}
\]

(a) Find the impulse response, that is, the time domain function $y(t)$ when $f(t) = \delta(t)$ is the impulse function, for $a = {-0.1, 0, 0.1}$.

(b) Indicate the poles of the transfer function for each of the values of $a$ on the complex plane.

(c) Plot your results for $t = 0$~s to $t = 20$~s for each case in Matlab and verify that your results are consistent with your answer to (a) and also qualitatively similar to those shown in the ``Pole map with responses'' on p. 3 of Lecture 14: Higher Order System Response.
