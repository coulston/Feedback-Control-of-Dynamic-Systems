\textcolor{red}{Note: this question might be confusing for students with the "none" answers for GM and PM in parts (a)-(b) depending on how unstable systems have been considered. To use, it might make sense to re-order so that it is clear that the closed-loop is unstable (from Nyquist) before asking how that impacts the GM and PM from the Bode plot. Alternatively, consider providing hints for (a) and (b) and updating the 'solnonly.'} Consider the following unity gain feedback system with Bode plot shown below. The forward gain $G(s)$ is stable. \\

\item What is the gain margin $\GMdB$?
\item What is the phase margin $\PM$?
\item Based on your knowledge of how the magnitude and phase in the Bode plot can be mapped in polar coordinates, which of the following is the correct Nyquist plot?\\
