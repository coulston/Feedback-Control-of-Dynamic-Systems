The open loop Bode plot for a system $G(s)$ with no unstable (open loop) poles is shown below. Assume that $G(s)$ is placed in the forward path of a negative unity gain feedback loop (``standard'' formulation). \textit{Note: the magnitude plot is zoomed in on the y axis for readability. The magnitude continues to decrease forever at the same slope for frequencies higher than 10 rad/s.}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What are the gain and phase margins?
\item  Sketch the Nyquist plot from the Bode plot on the axes provided.
\item  Use the Nyquist plot from part (b) to verify your gain margin from part (a). 
\end{enumerate}
