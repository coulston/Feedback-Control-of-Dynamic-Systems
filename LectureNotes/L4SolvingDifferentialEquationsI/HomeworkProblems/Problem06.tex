Use Laplace Transforms to answer the following question. A mass with $m=2$ kg is attached to a spring with spring constant $k=10$ N/m and is compressed so that $x=-1$ m. If the mass is released at time $t=0$, how long will it take for the mass to arrive back at $x=0$? (Note: it will pass beyond $x=0$ and continue to oscillate after that, but we are interested in the first time that it returns to $x=0$.)
