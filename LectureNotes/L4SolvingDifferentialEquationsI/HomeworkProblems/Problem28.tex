An LC circuit with inductor and capacitor in series, a voltage source $v_{in}$ connected to the inductor, and output voltage $v_{out}$ across the capacitor has transfer function 
\[
\frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)}=\frac{1}{3s^2+1}
\]
The source is suddenly turned on to 1 V, i.e. $v_{in}(t) = u(t)$. Find $v_{out}(t)$.
