You are studying the behavior of a car bumper during low velocity crashes. The car is modeled as a mass, and the bumper has a spring and damper (assuming no plastic deformation at low velocity).

\draw (D.-90) node[below=4pt] {$b$};
 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
When the bumper comes in contact with the barrier, the system is modeled by the differential equation
\[
m \ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + k x = 0
\]
Where $x$ is the position of the car relative to when contact is made (so that $x(0)=0$), $m$ is the car mass, $b$ is the bumper damping coefficient, and $k$ is the bumper spring constant. Suppose $m=1000$ kg, $b=2000$ N s m$^{-1}$, and $k=10,000$ N m$^{-1}$, and the initial velocity of the car is $\dot{x}(0) = 2$ m s$^{-1}$. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Find $x(t)$, $t\geq0$.
\item The solution is only valid for as long as the bumper remains in contact with the wall. For how long is the solution valid? 
\end{enumerate}
