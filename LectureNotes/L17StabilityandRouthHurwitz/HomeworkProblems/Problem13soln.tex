No, we can't make a reasonable argument about the BIBO-stability of the $CO_2$-to-temperature relationship given the plots provided. A bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stable system $G(s)$ will have a bounded (non-infinite) output signal for every bounded input signal. However, the data shown for the input signal - the atmospheric $CO_2$ concentration - does not appear to be bounded; instead, it appears that it will increase toward infinity as time increases. Therefore, even though the output signal - the temperature anomoly - also appears to be increasing in an unbounded manner, we cannot draw any conclusions from these two plots.

We also, therefore, cannot draw any conclusion about the likely locations of the poles of $G(s)$. If we had concluded that $G(s)$ was likely stable, we would have known that its poles should lie in the left half plane. If we had concluded that $G(s)$ was likely unstable, we would have known that at least one pole of $G(s)$ was located on the imaginary axis or in the right half plane.
