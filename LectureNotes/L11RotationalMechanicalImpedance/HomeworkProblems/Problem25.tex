Use Laplace Transforms to solve this problem: This tank has been filled to initial height $h(0)=7$ m, and we want to find out what happens when the valve is opened to the extent that the fluid resistance is $R=5$. The fluid density is $\rho=1$ kg/m$^3$, the tank area is $A=2$ m$^2$, and  $p_{a}$ denotes atmospheric pressure. The differential equation that describes this system is
\[
2\frac{dh}{dt}  + \frac{9.81}{5}h =0.
\]
Find the solution to this first order differential equation. \vspace{.2in}
