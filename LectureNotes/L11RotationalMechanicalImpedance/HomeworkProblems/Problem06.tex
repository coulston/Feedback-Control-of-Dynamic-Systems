The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a space observatory sensitive to x-ray sources. To make observations the observatory must be precisely oriented.

The observatory has a main body connected to solar panels on a lightweight frame. An ideal element model for motion of the the observatory around its major axis is shown in the following figure, where $\tau$ is the rotational torque applied by thrusters or reaction wheels, $\theta$ is the orientation of the main body, $J_1$ is the rotational inertia of the main body, and $J_2$ is the rotational inertia of the solar array, which has a flexible connection to the main body consistent with a damping ratio of $b$ and a spring constant $k$.

Find the transfer function from input $\tau$, the applied torque, to output $\theta$, the orientation of the satellite around is major axis.
