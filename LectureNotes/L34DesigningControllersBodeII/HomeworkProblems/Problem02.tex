Design a PI or PD controller for the system
\[
G(s) = \frac{1}{s(s+10)}
\]
to meet the following specifications
\begin{itemize}
\item Zero steady state error for unit step reference input
\item $t_{r}<$ 0.12 s
\item \%OS $<$ 10\%.
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Determine the low frequency gain, crossover frequency and phase margin necessary to meet the specifications.
\item Decide if $C(s)$ needs an integrator. Plot the Bode plot of either $G(s)$ or $G(s)/s$, depending on your choice.
\item Use \texttt{sisotool} (or iteration) to choose a gain and place a zero to meet the specifications.
\item Write the transfer function of the resulting controller $C(s)$, where $C(s)$ includes the integrator, if used. State whether this is a PI or PD controller.
\item Plot the bode plot of the loop gain $C(s)G(s)$, the Bode plot of the closed loop transfer function, and the closed loop step response.
\end{enumerate}
