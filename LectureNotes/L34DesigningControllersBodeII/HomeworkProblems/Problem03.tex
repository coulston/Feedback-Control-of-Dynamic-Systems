Using \texttt{sisotool}, design a PI or PD controller for the system
\[
G(s) = \frac{1}{(s+1)(s+10)}
\]
to meet the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item Zero steady state error for unit step reference input
\item $t_{r}<$ 0.5 s
\item \%OS $<$ 20\%.
\end{itemize}
Use Simulink to implement your control design (see Lecture 19, Section 5) and verify that the specifications are met.
