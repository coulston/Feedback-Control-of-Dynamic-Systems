\noindent\textbf{Instructional Activity:} 3 hours lecture, 0 hours lab, 3 semester hours.\\

%\noindent\textbf{Course designation:} Major Requirement (EE and ME)\\

\noindent\textbf{Course description from the Bulletin:}
\begin{quote}
System modeling through an energy flow approach is presented, with examples from linear electrical, mechanical, fluid and/or thermal systems. Analysis of system response in both the time domain and frequency domain is discussed in detail. Feedback control design techniques, including PID, are analyzed using both analytical and computational methods.

\begin{frame}{Prep Score}
The course is split into three intervals, each one associated with an exam. During each interval there will be
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 Homework Assignments - 10 points each
\item 2 Canvas Quizzes - 10 points each
\end{itemize}

Each prep score is out of 40 points, which includes the best 4 of the 6 scores from the group of homework and Canvas quizzes. 
The exception to this policy is Homework \#12 whoses score cannot be
droppped - you must complete this homework.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Homework}
\begin{itemize}
\item Homework is assigned weekly.
\item At least partial credit is given for each problem with a legitimate attempt.  Problems may be graded unequally.
\item Homework is due at 11:59pm on the due date. 
\item<2-> Homework must be turned in on Canvas/Gradescope. It must be submitted as a \textbf{single} .pdf file, readable, with \textbf{all pages right side up}. Files that are not submitted correctly will not be graded.
\item<3-> \textbf{No late homework is accepted for any reason}. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exams}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mid-term exams: There will be three in class exams during the semester, with dates given in the schedule below. Note these dates and plan accordingly!
\item No calculators are allowed in the exams. Graphs of important functions will be provided, but you will need to be able to do simple arithmetic by hand. You may not use your phone during exams. However, slide rules are allowed!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Absenteeism}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Sports/Activities Policy
\begin{itemize}
\item Alternate scheduling will be made available for exams.
\item Let your instructor know at least a week prior and they will work with you to make accommodations.
\item No extension for Canvas quizzes. 
\end{itemize}
\item<2-> Sickness/Life Issues
\begin{itemize}
\item If you are ill, pleased do not attend class, labs, or exams.
\item Complete the ``Request an Excused Absence'' form on the Mines website.
\item If you are going to miss an exam, email your professor ASAP to make alternate arrangements.
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Academic Honesty}
\mode<article>{The Colorado School of Mines affirms the principle that all individuals associated with the Mines academic community have a responsibility for establishing, maintaining and fostering an understanding and appreciation for academic integrity. In broad terms, this implies protecting the environment of mutual trust within which scholarly exchange occurs, supporting the ability of the faculty to fairly and effectively evaluate every student's academic achievements, and giving credence to the university's educational mission, its scholarly objectives and the substance of the degrees it awards. The protection of academic integrity requires there to be clear and consistent standards, as well as confrontation and sanctions when individuals violate those standards. The Colorado School of Mines desires an environment free of any and all forms of academic misconduct and expects students to act with integrity at all times.  

Academic misconduct is the intentional act of fraud, in which an individual seeks to claim credit for the work and efforts of another without authorization, or uses unauthorized materials or fabricated information in any academic exercise. Student Academic Misconduct arises when a student violates the principle of academic integrity. Such behavior erodes mutual trust, distorts the fair evaluation of academic achievements, violates the ethical code of behavior upon which education and scholarship rest, and undermines the credibility of the university. Because of the serious institutional and individual ramifications, student misconduct arising from violations of academic integrity is not tolerated at Mines. If a student is found to have engaged in such misconduct sanctions such as change of a grade, loss of institutional privileges, or academic suspension or dismissal may be imposed.}  
\\
For this course, the following rules should be followed:
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> All students must turn in individual homework (unless otherwise stated) and they must understand what they turn in.  
\item<3-> Copying of solutions without understanding them is not allowed; if a student copies a solution and cannot explain it adequately this is considered academic dishonesty. 
\item<4-> For computer exercises, each student is expected to generate his/her own solution (i.e. one cannot simply copy another person's computer solution and modify it slightly to make it look like it is your own work). 
\item<5-> During exams students must do 100 percent of the work on their own.
\item<6-> The nominal penalty for academic dishonesty is an 'F' in the course.
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{MATLAB}
\begin{itemize}
\item A tool for technical computing with a programming like interface. (You should have already taken Fortran, C, or Java.)
\item Easy access to highly optimized numerical methods.
\item You are responsible for becoming familiar with the MATLAB interface. If you are unfamiliar with MATLAB, we would recommend purchasing an introductory text, or make use of the myriad tutorials on the internet.
\item You will also find some introductory information about MATLAB in your textbook at the end of most chapters and in the appendix.
\item Instructions for accessing MATLAB from your laptop (called remote access) can be found here: \url{http://inside.mines.edu/Matlab}.
\end{itemize}
